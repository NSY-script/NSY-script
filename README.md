## Hi there 👋

I’m **Najib Sunusi**, a **QA Automation Engineer in the making**, learning by building real test systems, breaking applications, and improving test design.

I believe good test engineers are built through practice, not titles.

---

### 🧠 How I think about testing
- Automation code is production code
- Clear tests beat clever tests
- Flaky tests mean poor design, not bad luck

---

### 🔭 Current focus
- Python-based test automation
- UI and API testing working together
- Writing maintainable, reusable test code
- Understanding how automation fits into CI/CD pipelines

---

### 🧪 Testing stack
- **UI Automation:** Selenium + PyTest  
- **API Testing:** REST APIs, JSON, Python Requests  
- **Test Design:** Page Object Model, reusable test flows

### 📂 Featured project
🔹 **Flow-Driven UI Testing**  
🔗 https://github.com/NSY-script/flow-driven-ui-testing.git

### 🎯 Career goal
To become a QA Automation Engineer teams trust to confidently say:  
> “This build is ready to ship.”
