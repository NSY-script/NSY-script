## Hi there 👋

I’m **Najib Sunusi** — growing into an **SDET** by building real things, breaking them, and fixing the process.

I believe SDETs aren’t born — they’re built through practice.

---

### 🧠 How I think as an SDET
- Code is a product, tests are a product too
- Readability > cleverness
- If a test is flaky, the design is wrong

---

### 🔭 Current focus
- Python-based automation frameworks
- API testing as first-class testing
- Clean architecture for test code
- Learning how tests fit into CI/CD

---

### 🧪 Testing stack
- UI: Selenium + PyTest
- API: REST, JSON, Python Requests
- Design: Page Object Model, reusable flows

---

### 📂 Real project
🔹 Flow-Driven UI Testing  
🔗 https://github.com/NSY-script/flow-driven-ui-testing.git

---

### 🎯 Goal
Become the engineer teams trust to say:  
> “Yes, this is safe to release.”
